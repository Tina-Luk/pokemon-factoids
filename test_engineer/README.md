# Test Engineer Test: 'TODO MVP'

Welcome to the test engineer code test! This will be a test of your:
1. Ability to troubleshoot
2. Organizational capabilities

The point of this test is to understand how you approach a technical problem. The way you approach these problems are just as important as your solutions.

We expect this test to take you about 4 - 8 hours. Given that most people are busy, we'd like to hear back from you within 72 hours of starting.

## Overall Requirements

Your task is to take charge of the Quality Assurance for the attached web application. It is a simple TODO application in which a user can Add and Remove todos, as well as mark todo's as Done or Undone.

It is your task to create a QA testing approach to ensure the quality of this product. This is a twofold process.

1. Create a manual testing script using whatever tools you prefer, and generate for our team a testing report of your testing against this todo app
2. Create an automated testing mechanism using whatever tools you prefer.

#### As soon as you begin:
* [ ] Fork this repository into a public repository on your gitlab/etc account
